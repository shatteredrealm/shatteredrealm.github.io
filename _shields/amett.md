title: Amett
---

Cleaved by a rift in the earth, Amett is scarred by a crevasse formed by an ever bubbling lava river. These elemental forces have shaped a lively and boisterous community that shares everything in order to survive in a challenging environment. Most life is contained to smaller domes that act as greenhouses to protect delicate growth from the dangers of the bubbling earth

Governed by consensus, wisdom of youth.
