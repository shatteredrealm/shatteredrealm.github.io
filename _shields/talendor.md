One of the largest bubbles, the land is rich and fertile. Supplements the Haven’s own agriculture and brave seafarers trade along the coast.

- Main city is Warea, on the Cerulean Expanse, where it’s port is protected by the edge of the shield and hosts the rare ship that hugs the coast down to Haven
- Luckbourne: village in the heart of the agricultural center
- Turangi, on the shores of Lake Hawea. Druidic/religious center.
Ruled by a “elected” lord in Warea (elected from a small pool of noble families)
